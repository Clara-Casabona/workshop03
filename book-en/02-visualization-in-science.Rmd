# Data visualization

Before we start looking at *how* we can visualize our data, let's first answer *why* data visualization is important. Here is a non-exhaustive list of reasons to visualize your data:

**1.** To represent results of statistical analyses 

**2.** To formulate hypotheses and summarize theory

**3.** To explore your data so that you understand it better (exploratory analysis, outlier detection)

**4.** To communicate and report your findings to others
  - Clearly (using good design principles)
  - Precisely and accurately (a plot is worth 1000 words)
  - Effectively and efficiently
  
  
Here is an example of an *ineffective* visualization:

.center[![:scale 65%](images/piechart3d.png)]

What is wrong with this image? Try to answer for yourself what you think this figure is trying to communicate and whether it is successful. How could this image be improved?

To ensure you are communicating effectively, here are some important questions to ask yourself while visualizing your data:

-     What do you want to communicate?
-     Who is your audience?
-     What is the best way to do it?

**A good rule of thumb: think simple! use less ink!**

#Why use `R`?

What is the advantage to using `R` for data visualization?

##Reproducibility

One of the main reasons to use  `R` for plotting is that it makes your visualization entirely reprocible. You can annotate your script, add additional information (ex. titles, labels, captions, etc), and maintain the code for all versions of your figures so you always know how it was produced. 

Reproducible science comes with effort, but it is quickly becoming an **industry standard** and is an investment that will save you and your collaborators a lot of time in the long run!

##Powerful features

Another reason to use `R` is its powerful features. 

In this workshop, we focus only on `ggplot2`, but there are many other [packages and functions](https://insileco.github.io/wiki/rgraphpkgs/) that can be used for great visualization (e.g., [`base R`](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html), [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/r/), [`sjPlot`](http://www.strengejacke.de/sjPlot/), [`mapview`](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/), [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/r/)).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.7}
source(file="./scripts/multiExamplePlot.R")
```

The reason that we focus on `ggplot2` is due to its **versatility**.

**1.** The [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package lets you make *beautiful* and customizable plots;

**2.** It implements the grammar of graphics, a reliable system for building plots.

**3.** It [has many extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/), allowing for a wealth of applications.
