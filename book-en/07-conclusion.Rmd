# Concluding remarks

There are other useful packages that can be used with `ggplot2`! 

To name a few: `ggbio`, `ggpmisc`, `geomnet`, `gganimate`, `ggnetwork` and `ggtree`. Have a look at [www.ggplot2-exts.org](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/) for other `ggplot2` extensions.

Note that you can learn more about design and image manipulation with the QCBS workshop "Introduction to graphic design and image manipulation with open source tools": https://qcbs.ca/wiki/graphics
