# Saving plots in code

`ggsave()` writes directly to your working directory and allows you to specify the name of the file, the dimensions of the plot, the resolution, etc.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my1rstPlot <- 
  ggplot(penguins, 
         aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave("my1stPlot.pdf",
       my1rstPlot,
       height = 8.5, width = 11, units = "in", res = 300)
```

NB: Vectors (e.g., pdf, svg) format are more flexible than raster format (jpeg,
png, ...) if the image needs modification afterwards.

Other methods to save image: see `?pdf` `?jpeg`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf("./graph_du_jour.pdf")
  print(my1rstPlot) # print function is necessary
graphics.off()
```

**Tip:** `quartz()` (mac) or `window()` (pc) functions make sizing easier before `ggsave()`!

???

note: _this function allows to resize plot live, then use ggsave without specifying plot._

# Concluding remarks
<br>

  1. There are other useful packages that can be used with `ggplot2`! To name a few: `ggbio`, `ggpmisc`, `geomnet`, `gganimate`, `ggnetwork` and `ggtree`. Have a look at [www.ggplot2-exts.org](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/) for other `ggplot2` extensions.


  2. Note that you can learn more about design and image manipulation with the "Introduction to graphic design and image manipulation with open source tools": https://qcbs.ca/wiki/graphics
