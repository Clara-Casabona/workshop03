# (PART\*) Fine-tuning your plots {-}

# Using `theme()` to make it look good! {#theme}

## Introduction to themes

This presentation has been using theme_classic() for the plots, because the grey background can make certain colours harder to see. These are good options for publishing figures.

But, like every other part of the grammar of graphics, we can modify the theme of the plot to suit our needs, or higher sense of style! 

There are way too many theme elements built into the ggplot2 package to mention here, but you can find a complete list in the ggplot [theme vignette](http://docs.ggplot2.org/dev/vignettes/themes.html). Instead of
modifying the many elements contained in `theme()`, you can start from theme functions, which contain a specific set of elements from which to start. Here are some examples:

### Default: Grey

```{r, fig.align='center'}
# Theme grey
pp + scale_colour_grey() + # Make data points gray
  theme_grey() + # Make background gray
  labs(title = "Default: Grey") # Title plot
```


### Theme Classic

```{r, fig.align='center'}
pp + scale_colour_grey() +# Make data points gray
  theme_classic() + # Make background white
  labs(title = "Classic") # Title plot
```

### Theme Minimal
```{r, fig.align='center'}
pp + scale_colour_grey() +
  theme_minimal() + # Make background white with gray gridlines 
  labs(title = "Minimal")
```

### Setting the theme across all plots

As you may have noticed, `ggplot` code can quickly become long when you constantly need to specify the characteristics of the theme you want to use. When you are making multiple plots and want them to all have the same theme, you can simple use `theme_set()` to set the theme for all plots that are generated afterwards, or `theme_update()` to edit elements of an existing theme setting without rewriting all the other theme elements.

#### Setting a theme

```{r, fig.align='center'}
# Set black & white theme as default
theme_set(theme_bw()) # Note the background is white with a black frame
pp
```

After using `theme_set()`, our `pp` plot is generated with the black & white theme `theme_bw()`. Any future plots generated in your R session would also be generated with this theme.

#### Updating a theme

Perhaps the minor gridlines are not necessary for this plot, though we like everything else about our theme. Rather than rewriting several lines of code to respecify the theme, we can simply use `theme_update()` to adjust a specific element of our theme.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
# remove minor gridlines 
theme_update(
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) # Adjust gridline scale
pp
```

There! Much better!

```{r, include=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# quickly reset the theme for the rest of the book
theme_set(theme_bw())
theme_update(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
             axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
             axis.title = element_text(size = 18))
```


## Elements of a theme

Here is a helpful infographic to help you customize your theme to fit your exact needs!

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "ggplot2 theme reference sheet by Isabella Benabaye ([source](https://isabella-b.com/blog/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference/)).", purl = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggthemes.png")
```

## Building your own theme

Once you become more comfortable with customizing existing ggplot [themes](http://docs.ggplot2.org/dev/vignettes/themes.html), you might want to think about creating your own theme to add to your plots. This is a great way to make your plots stand out in a presentation, a publication, a website, or wherever else they find a home!

Here is an example:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mytheme <- theme_bw() + # You can start from an existing theme to get some of the basic elements set up
           theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "red")) +
           theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9))
pp + mytheme # Apply it to your plot!
```


## More themes

The [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes) package is a great project developed by Jeffrey Arnold on GitHub and also hosted on the CRAN repository. The package contains many themes, geoms, and colour ramps for `ggplot2` which are based on the works of some of the most renown and influential names in the world of data visualization, from the classics such as [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) to the modern data journalists and programmers at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) blog.

The package can be installed as follows:

```{r, message = FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)
```

We can then apply some of these themes (and more) to our plot!

```{r}
# Let's use the FiveThirtyEight blog's theme, and Tableau's color palette
pp + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
  scale_color_tableau()
```

```{r}
# Let's use Tufte's "Maximal Data, Minimal Ink" theme
pp + 
  theme_tufte()
```


# Using facets to split up your plot

## Facetting by one variable

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                           y = bill_depth_mm, 
                           colour = species)) +
  facet_grid(~ species, 
             scales = "free") # the scale of the y axis can vary between facets.
# do not do this if you are comparing facets via the y axis!
```


## Facetting by two variables

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                           y = bill_depth_mm, 
                           colour = species)) +
  facet_grid(year ~ species, 
             scales = "free")
```


## Title and axes components: size, colour and face

Let us come back to our default plot that we have been building on.

```{r}
# our default plot from before
pp
```

We can tune the axes and titles to make the information clearer, so the plot can speak for itself.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=7,message=FALSE}
# Tuning axes and titles to make the plot speak for itself
pp +
  # Label the title, axes, and color legend
  labs(title = "Relationship between Bill Length & Depth",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
       col = "Species") +
  # adjust the size of these labels
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face="bold"), # bold the title
        legend.title = element_text(size=14, face="bold"), # bold the legend title
        legend.text = element_text(size=12))
```



## Challenge 3

Use the `tips` dataset found in `reshape2` &#x1F4E6; to reproduce the plot below. 

```{r}
# install and load the package
install.packages("reshape2")
library(reshape2)

### Challenge 3: Solution

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Build the plot
tips.gg <- ggplot(tips, 
                  
                  # Step 1. Specify the aesthetic mapping from the axes and the legends
                  aes(x = total_bill,
                      y = tip/total_bill,
                      shape = smoker,
                      colour = sex,
                      size = size)) +
  # Step 2. Specify the geom used to represent the data
  geom_point() +
  # Step 3. Specify the variable used to make facets
  facet_grid( ~ time) +
  # Step 4. set the colour scale used to represent sex 
  scale_colour_grey() +
  # Step 5. Label the plot title and axes
  labs(title = "Relation between total bill and tips during lunch and dinner",
       x = "Total bill ($)", 
       y = "Ratio between tips and total bill") +
  # Step 6. Set the theme
  theme_classic() +
  # Step 7. Customise the theme to match the sizing and colour of the plot labels
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16,
                                  colour = "navy"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16,
                                  colour = "orange3",
                                  face = "bold"),
        # this part adjusts the text in the facet labels (strips!)
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14, face="bold"))
# print our beautiful plot!
tips.gg
```


# Using `geom_*()` to create different plots

Multiple geoms can be used together in a single plot! The order determines how they overlap.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", purl = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plots_in_various_contexts.png")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_bw())
theme_update(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
             axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
             axis.title = element_text(size = 18))
```

This is a blank plot, before we add any `geom_*` to represent variables in the dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)
```

## Histograms: `geom_histogram()`

A **histogram** is an accurate graphical representation of the distribution of numeric data. There is only one aesthetic required: the `x` variable.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of penguin bill length ")
```

## Scatterplot and linear-fit: `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`

A scatter plot is a great way to visualize data points for two variables. Two aesthetics are required in `geom_point()`: the `x` and `y` variables.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, 
       aes(x = displ, 
           y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot")
```

It can, however, be difficult to discern any potential relationship in a scatter plot. You can use `geom_smooth()` to fit a line through your data with a variety of methods. Here, we will add a linear fit to the scatter plot.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, 
       aes(x = displ, 
           y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression") 
```

## Boxplot: `geom_boxplot()`

Boxplots are a popular way to plot the distribution of data across some grouping variable, like species. You can specify this grouping variable in  `aes()` using `group =`, or the aesthetics used to represent the data (`fill =`, `col = `, `shape = `) to generate the boxplot.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = species, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           fill = species)) + # specify species as a grouping variable
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot")
```

:::explanation
Though boxplots are very popular to summarise data, someone looking at your plot may not intuitively grasp how this summary works and what it might be hiding. Using boxplots well requires an understanding of their anatomy, as seen below. More on the pitfalls of boxplots [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Anatomy of a boxplot by [Denise Coleman](https://www.leansigmacorporation.com/box-plot-with-minitab/).", purl = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/boxplot_explain.png")
```
:::


Boxplot with annotations: `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_signif()`

geom_signif calculates the significance of a difference between groups and adds the annotation to the plot in a single line.

```{r, fig.align="center",fig.height=5.5, eval = FALSE}
library(ggsignif)
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = species, 
           y= bill_length_mm,
           fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(comparisons = 
                list(c("Adelie", "Gentoo")),
              map_signif_level=TRUE)
```


```{r, fig.align="center",fig.height=5.5, echo = FALSE}
library(ggsignif)
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = species, 
           y= bill_length_mm,
           fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # specify the comparison we are interested in
  geom_signif(comparisons = 
                list(c("Adelie", "Gentoo")),
              map_signif_level=TRUE)
```


## Violin plot: `geom_violin()`

As explained on https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html

> Violin plot allows to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable for one or several groups. [...] It is really close to a boxplot, but allows a deeper understanding of the distribution.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
# Data
names <- c(rep("A", 80) , rep("B", 50) , rep("C", 70))
value <- c(sample(2:5, 80 ,replace=TRUE), sample(4:10, 50 , replace=TRUE),
       sample(1:7, 70 , replace=TRUE))
data <- data.frame(names,value)

#Graph
qplot(x=names ,y=value ,data=data ,geom=c("boxplot","jitter") ,fill=names)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = data, aes(names, value, fill=names)) + geom_violin()

```


```{r, fig.align="center"}
violin <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                 aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, fill = "grey70", alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Violin plot")
violin
```

Violin plot: `geom_violin()` + `_boxplot()` + `_jitter()`

```{r, fig.align="center"}
violin + 
    geom_jitter(shape = 16, position = position_jitter(0.2),
              alpha = .3)+
  geom_boxplot(width = .05)
```

## Summarise y values: `stat_summary()`

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
ggplot(mtcars, 
       aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "median", 
               geom = "point",
               colour = "red",
               size = 6) +
  labs(title = "Means")
```


```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
ggplot(mtcars, 
       aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot",
               colour = "red",
               size = 1.6) +
  labs(title = "Means and confidence intervals")
```


See also `geom_errorbar()`, `geom_pointrange()`, `geom_linerange()`, `geom_crossbar()` for geoms to display summarised data.


## Representing maps: `geom_map()`


```{r}
crimes <- data.frame(state = tolower(rownames(USArrests)), USArrests)
crimesm <- reshape2::melt(crimes, id = 1)

library(maps)
states_map <- map_data("state")

ggplot(crimes, aes(map_id = state)) +
  geom_map(aes(fill = Murder), map = states_map) +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +
  coord_map()
```


## Density plots: `geom_density()`

A density plot shows the distribution of a numerical variable and it takes only set of numeric values as input.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4.4}
(peng.dens <- 
   ggplot(penguins, 
          aes(bill_length_mm)) +
   geom_density())
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4.4}
(cars.dens <- 
   ggplot(cars, aes(dist)) +
   geom_density())
```


## Dendogram: `ggdendrogram()`

```{r}
library(ggdendro)
USArrests.short = USArrests[1:10,]
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests.short), "ave")

ggdendrogram(hc, rotate = TRUE, theme_dendro = FALSE)
```


## Arrange plots: `patchwork`

**Add multiple graphs on the same plot**

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
peng.dens + cars.dens +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a')
```

       y = "log10(Brain weight (Kg))") +
  scale_fill_grey() +
  theme_classic()
```

Solution example #2

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
data(mtcars)
mtcars.short <- mtcars[1:20,]
mtcars.short.hc <- hclust(dist(mtcars.short), "complete")
dendro.challenge4 <- ggdendrogram(mtcars.short.hc, 
                                  rotate = TRUE, theme_dendro = FALSE)
dendro.challenge4 + 
  labs(title = "Car dendro from motor spec", y ="Cars") +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face="bold"))
```


## Miscellaneous: interactive plots using `plotly()`

**Select the species data to display directly from the legend**

You can click on the species in the legend to add/remove species. You can also see values while hovering over points.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(penguins,
           aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
               colour = species, shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size=6, alpha=0.6)
# convert to a plotly object!
ggplotly(p)
```
