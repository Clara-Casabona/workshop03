# (PART\*) Fine-tuning your plots {-}

# Using `theme()` to make it look good! {#theme}

## Introduction to themes

This book has been using `theme_classic()` for the plots, because the default grey background can make certain colours harder to see.

But, like every other part of the grammar of graphics, we can modify the theme of the plot to suit our needs, or higher sense of style! 

There are way too many theme elements built into the `ggplot2` package to mention here, but you can find a complete list in the [theme vignette](http://docs.ggplot2.org/dev/vignettes/themes.html). Instead of
modifying the many elements contained in `theme()`, you can start from theme functions, which contain a specific set of elements from which to start. Here are some examples:

### Default: Grey

```{r, fig.align='center', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Theme grey
pp + scale_colour_grey() + # Make data points gray
  theme_grey() + # Make background gray
  labs(title = "Default: Grey") # Title plot
```


### Theme Classic

```{r, fig.align='center', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pp + scale_colour_grey() +# Make data points gray
  theme_classic() + # Make background white
  labs(title = "Classic") # Title plot
```

### Theme Minimal
```{r, fig.align='center', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pp + scale_colour_grey() +
  theme_minimal() + # Make background white with gray gridlines 
  labs(title = "Minimal")
```

### Setting the theme across all plots

As you may have noticed, `ggplot` code can quickly become long when you constantly need to specify the characteristics of the theme you want to use. When you are making multiple plots and want them to all have the same theme, you can simple use `theme_set()` to set the theme for all plots that are generated afterwards, or `theme_update()` to edit elements of an existing theme setting without rewriting all the other theme elements.

#### Setting a theme

```{r, fig.align='center', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Set black & white theme as default
theme_set(theme_bw()) # Note the background is white with a black frame
pp
```

After using `theme_set()`, our `pp` plot is generated with the black & white theme `theme_bw()`. Any future plots generated in your R session would also be generated with this theme.

#### Updating a theme

Perhaps the minor gridlines are not necessary for this plot, though we like everything else about our theme. Rather than rewriting several lines of code to respecify the theme, we can simply use `theme_update()` to adjust a specific element of our theme.

```{r, fig.align='center', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# remove minor gridlines 
theme_update(
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) # Adjust gridline scale
pp
```

There! Much better!

```{r, include=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# set the theme for the rest of the book
theme_set(theme_bw())
theme_update(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
             axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
             axis.title = element_text(size = 18))
```


## Elements of a theme

Here is a helpful infographic to help you customize your theme to fit your exact needs!

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "ggplot2 theme reference sheet by Isabella Benabaye ([source](https://isabella-b.com/blog/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference/)).", purl = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggthemes.png")
```

## Building your own theme

Once you become more comfortable with customizing existing ggplot [themes](http://docs.ggplot2.org/dev/vignettes/themes.html), you might want to think about creating your own theme to add to your plots. This is a great way to make your plots stand out in a presentation, a publication, a website, or wherever else they find a home!

Here is an example:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mytheme <- theme_bw() + # You can start from an existing theme to get some of the basic elements set up
           theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "red")) +
           theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9))
pp + mytheme # Apply it to your plot!
```


## More themes

The [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes) package is a great project developed by Jeffrey Arnold on GitHub and also hosted on the CRAN repository. The package contains many themes, geoms, and colour ramps for `ggplot2` which are based on the works of some of the most renown and influential names in the world of data visualization, from the classics such as [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) to the modern data journalists and programmers at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) blog.

The package can be installed as follows:

```{r, message = FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)
```

We can then apply some of these themes (and more) to our plot!

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Let's use the FiveThirtyEight blog's theme, and Tableau's color palette
pp + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
  scale_color_tableau()
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Let's use Tufte's "Maximal Data, Minimal Ink" theme
pp + 
  theme_tufte()
```


# Using facets to split up your plot

## Facetting by one variable

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                           y = bill_depth_mm, 
                           colour = species)) +
  facet_grid(~ species, 
             scales = "free") # the scale of the y axis can vary between facets.
# do not do this if you are comparing facets via the y axis!
```


## Facetting by two variables

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                           y = bill_depth_mm, 
                           colour = species)) +
  facet_grid(year ~ species, 
             scales = "free")
```


## Title and axes components: size, colour and face

Let us come back to our default plot that we have been building on.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Let's come back to our penguin plot from before
pp
```

We can tune the axes and titles to make the information clearer, so the plot can speak for itself.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=7,warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Tuning axes and titles to make the plot speak for itself
pp +
  # Label the title, axes, and color legend
  labs(title = "Relationship between Bill Length & Depth",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
       col = "Species") +
  # adjust the size of these labels
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face="bold"), # bold the title
        legend.title = element_text(size=14, face="bold"), # bold the legend title
        legend.text = element_text(size=12))
```

                            y = tip/total_bill,
                            shape = smoker,
                            colour = sex,

### Challenge 3: Solution

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Build the plot
tips.gg <- ggplot(tips, 
                  # Step 1. Specify the aesthetic mapping from the axes and the legends
                  aes(x = total_bill,
                      y = tip/total_bill,
                      shape = smoker,
                      colour = sex,
                      size = size)) +
  # Step 2. Specify the geom used to represent the data
  geom_point() +
  # Step 3. Specify the variable used to make facets
  facet_grid( ~ time) +
  # Step 4. set the colour scale used to represent sex 
  scale_colour_grey() +
  # Step 5. Label the plot title and axes
  labs(title = "Relation between total bill and tips during lunch and dinner",
       x = "Total bill ($)", 
       y = "Ratio between tips and total bill") +
  # Step 6. Set the theme
  theme_classic() +
  # Step 7. Customise the theme to match the sizing and colour of the plot labels
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16,
                                  colour = "navy"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16,
                                  colour = "orange3",
                                  face = "bold"),
        # this part adjusts the text in the facet labels (strips!)
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14, face="bold"))
# print our beautiful plot!
tips.gg
```


# Using `geom_*()` to create different plots

Multiple geoms can be used together in a single plot! The order determines how they overlap.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", purl = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plots_in_various_contexts.png")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_bw())
theme_update(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
             axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
             axis.title = element_text(size = 18))
```

This is a blank plot, before we add any `geom_*` to represent variables in the dataset.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins)
```

## Histograms: `geom_histogram()`

A **histogram** is an accurate graphical representation of the distribution of numeric data. There is only one aesthetic required: the `x` variable.

```{r, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of penguin bill length ")
```

## Scatterplot and linear-fit: `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`

A scatter plot is a great way to visualize data points for two variables. Two aesthetics are required in `geom_point()`: the `x` and `y` variables.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, 
       aes(x = displ, 
           y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot")
```

It can, however, be difficult to discern any potential relationship in a scatter plot. You can use `geom_smooth()` to fit a line through your data with a variety of methods. Here, we will add a linear fit to the scatter plot.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, 
       aes(x = displ, 
           y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression") 
```

## Boxplot: `geom_boxplot()`

Boxplots are a popular way to plot the distribution of data across some grouping variable, like species. You can specify this grouping variable in  `aes()` using `group =`, or the aesthetics used to represent the data (`fill =`, `col = `, `shape = `) to generate the boxplot.

```{r, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = species, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           fill = species)) + # specify species as a grouping variable
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot")
```

:::explanation
Though boxplots are very popular to summarise data, someone looking at your plot may not intuitively grasp how this summary works and what it might be hiding. Using boxplots well requires an understanding of their anatomy, as seen below. More on the pitfalls of boxplots [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Anatomy of a boxplot by [Denise Coleman](https://www.leansigmacorporation.com/box-plot-with-minitab/).", purl = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/boxplot_explain.png")
```
:::

## Annotated boxplot: `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_signif()`

To help boxplots speak for themselves, we can add annotations with `geom_signif()`. The function `geom_signif()` calculates the significance of a difference between groups and adds the annotation to the plot in a single line of code.

```{r, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggsignif)
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = species, 
           y= bill_length_mm,
           fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(
    # which groups should be compared?
    comparisons = list(c("Adelie", "Gentoo")), 
    map_signif_level=TRUE)
```


## Violin plot: `geom_violin()`

Like boxplots, violin plots visualise the distribution of a numeric variable for one or several groups. However, a violin's shape represents the distribution of points that is obscured in a boxplot's summarisation, allowing for a more accurate representation of the data ([Data-to-Viz)](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html)).

:::explanation
Let us compare a boxplot and a violin plot on some generated data. Notice how the violin plot *shows* us the range **and** the variability in our data, while the boxplot cannot communicate these two things as intuitively.

<div class = "split">
<div class = "split-left">
```{r, echo=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# Generate some data
names <- c(rep("A", 80) , rep("B", 50) , rep("C", 70))
value <- c(sample(2:5, 80 ,replace=TRUE), sample(4:10, 50 , replace=TRUE),
       sample(1:7, 70 , replace=TRUE))
data <- data.frame(names,value)

# Plot it as a boxplot with the data points jittered on top
qplot(x = names, y = value, data = data, geom = c("boxplot","jitter"), fill = names)
```

</div>
<div class = "split-right">
```{r, echo=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# plot the data as a violin plot
ggplot(data = data, aes(names, value, fill=names)) + geom_violin()
```
</div>
</div>
:::


We can make a violin plot with our `penguins` data:

```{r, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
violin <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                 aes(x = species, 
                     y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, # do not trim the violins' tips if there are outliers
              fill = "grey70", # set all the violins to grey
              alpha = .5) + # transparency of the fill colour
  labs(title = "Violin plot")
violin
```


Although we have a good idea of how the data is distributed, we can enhance the plot by visualising some summary statistics and the data points. Let us plot a boxplot and the data points *on top* of our violin plot with `geom_violin()` + `geom_boxplot()` + `geom_jitter()`.

```{r, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
violin + 
  # this geom plots the data points with some additional (horizontal) noise
  # to see overlapping points
    geom_jitter(shape = 16, 
                position = position_jitter(0.2),
              alpha = .3) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .05)
```


## Summarise `y` values: `stat_summary()`

Adding summary statistics to your plot can help to highlight the key message in your plot. The function `stat_summary()` can run the summary statistic of your choice using the argument `fun = `, and add it to your plot according to the `geom = ` you have set in the function.

For example, if we wanted to plot the median of the number of cylinders (`cyl`) in the `mtcars` dataset, we would use `stat_summary()` in the following way:

```{r}
# plot the median of the number of cylinders
ggplot(mtcars, 
       aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun = "median", 
               geom = "point",
               colour = "red",
               size = 6) +
  labs(title = "Medians")
```

Though the median is a helpful summary statistics, it does not inform us about the uncertainty behind it. If we wanted to instead plot the mean of each group with bootstrapped confidence intervals, we could just switch the `fun.y = ` argument:

```{r}
# plot the mean of each group with bootstrapped confidence intervals
ggplot(mtcars, 
       aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot",
               colour = "red",
               size = 1.6) +
  labs(title = "Means and confidence intervals")
```


For more summary statistics, see `geom_errorbar()`, `geom_pointrange()`, `geom_linerange()`, `geom_crossbar()`.


## Representing maps: `geom_map()`

We will map the arrests per 100,000 residents for murder in each of the 50 US states in 1973 from the `USArrests` dataset with `geom_map()`.

```{r}
# load maps library
library(maps)
states_map <- map_data("state") # get a state-level map of the US

# State name is set as rownames. Let's make a new column for these
# that matches the column of state names in our states_map
USArrests$region <- tolower(rownames(USArrests))

# Build our map
ggplot(USArrests, 
       aes(map_id = region)) + # the variable name to link our map and dataframe
  geom_map(aes(fill = Murder), # variable we want to represent with an aesthetic
           map = states_map) + # data frame that contains coordinates
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, 
                y = states_map$lat) +
  coord_map() +  # projection 
  labs(x = "", y = "") # remove axis labels
```


## Density plots: `geom_density()`

A density plot shows the distribution of a numerical variable and it takes only set of numeric values as input.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
(peng.dens <- ggplot(penguins, 
                     aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
   geom_density())
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
(cars.dens <- ggplot(cars, 
                    aes(x = dist)) +
   geom_density())
```


## Dendogram: `ggdendrogram()`

Which US states have similar arrest rates?

```{r}
library(ggdendro)

USArrests.short <- USArrests[1:10,] # take a small sample for simplicity
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests.short), "average") # cluster by average distance (UPGMA)

# plot the clustering dendrogram
ggdendrogram(hc, rotate = TRUE)
```


# Arrange plots: `patchwork`

So far, we have used facets to split our plot into multiple windows. However, this is restricted to plotting the same variables from the same dataset. 

The `patchwork` package makes it easy to arrange separate ggplots together in one frame with `+` (arrange plots beside each other), `/` (arrange one plot on top of the other), `()` (group this arrangement of plots)  as though you are writing an equation.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load patchwork to arrange our density plots
library(patchwork)

# adding them together means "place them beside each other"
peng.dens + cars.dens +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a') # adds a) and b) to your plots, to reference
# in your figure captions.
```
